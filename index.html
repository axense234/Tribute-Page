            White started making YouTube videos in 2006, when he uploaded music and AMVs to his old channels.[9][10] He created his
            penguinz0 YouTube channel on May 7, 2007.[11] On August 5, he uploaded his first non-deleted video, which featured
            gameplay of Gears of War.[12] During this time, he streamed live on Justin.tv from late 2009 to early 2010.[13]
            
            White's audience rapidly grew after he uploaded a video titled The Most Difficult Game Ever Created Gameplay and
            Commentary, in which he commentates while playing the online game QWOP and calls it "the hardest game he had ever
            played". The video gained popularity after Ray William Johnson reviewed it on his series Equals Three, in which he
            praises White's sense of humor.[14][15] In 2013, White was cited by Tubefilter as panning YouTube's new comment system,
            which required a Google+ account to leave comments on videos.[16]
            
            In 2012, White expressed his desire to donate all of his YouTube earnings to charity.[17] Later that year, he announced
            he had signed a partnership with Maker Studios and had set up a Twitter account to disclose his charity donations.[18]
            On September 2, 2014, he made a video expressing his gratitude to his fandom for helping him reach the
            one-million-subscriber milestone and said he has donated over $50,000 from his YouTube earnings to charity.[19]
            
            In 2015, after eight years of anonymity, White made his Snapchat username, "big_moist", public, revealing his face. He
            uploaded his first video showing his face on camera on March 5, 2017.[10]
            
            In early 2015, White began speaking about various topics, including internet drama. He drew attention from media outlets
            for his commentary videos,[20] which were often of discourse about online platforms and considerably critical of
            YouTube's policies.[21][6]
            
            In December 2016, White began co-hosting The Official Podcast with fellow Internet personalities ZealotOnPC, Huggbees,
            and Kaya Orsan.[22]
            
            Media outlets sparsely referenced White's gameplay videos; his 2015 video on Ark: Survival Evolved was referenced by The
            Daily Star.[23] The Daily Dot wrote that White is known for his "sardonic commentary."[24] In February 2016, The
            Guardian included his video reaction to the Fine Brothers' React World controversy in their coverage of the
            situation.[25] Kotaku referenced White's 2017 video demonstrating character customization in Mass Effect: Andromeda.[26]
